+ Project summary: Machine Learning Fairness refers to correcting the unfairness for certain groups or individuals in machine learning algorithms' predictions. For this project, our team worked on A4 Fairness Beyond Disparate Treatment & Disparate Impact: Learning Classification without Disparate Mistreatment (DM and DM-sen) and A6 Handling Conditional Discrimination (LM and LPS) to compare their accuracy in predicting the rate a particular person would re-offend in next two years.
